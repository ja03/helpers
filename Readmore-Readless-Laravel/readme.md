## How does it work?
- We utilize Laravel Blade files along with jQuery for JavaScript functionality and Sass for our CSS framework. The status of the class of the actual content we manipulate is switched dynamically. jQuery manages this by checking the state of assigned attributes for each element, allowing us to add or remove classes and switch button text accordingly.
